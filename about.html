                            started while I wait on my food. Large portions of food that are so delicious. The rice is a
                            little more cooked than I like but still has good flavor! Over all I had a great experience
                            & would recommend! Also our server Amanda did an amazing job she is very passionate about
                            her job and it shows! I will be asking for her as my server ever time."
